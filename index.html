          <h1>🥐Croissant: Quintessential French Baking</h1>
          <p>
            A croissant (French pronunciation: [kʁwasɑ̃] (listen)) is a buttery,
            flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian
            kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated
            dough.[1][better source needed] Croissants are named for their
            historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled
            and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin
            sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
            layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
